feat(auth): Refactor authentication logic into AuthService

This commit introduces a significant refactoring of the authentication and authorization layer to improve separation of concerns and align with Clean Architecture principles.

- **Introduce AuthService**: A new `AuthService` is created in `app/services/auth_service.py` to encapsulate all business logic related to user authentication (verifying credentials and creating JWTs). The login endpoint now delegates directly to this service.

- **Centralize Dependencies**: A new `app/api/v1/deps.py` file is created to act as the single source of truth for dependency injection. This centralizes providers for services, repositories, and the current authenticated user (`CurrentUser`).

- **Decouple Core Logic**: The JWT decoding logic in `app/core/security.py` is now a "pure" function (`decode_access_token`) that raises a custom domain exception (`InvalidTokenError`) and has no dependency on FastAPI's `HTTPException`, making it more reusable and testable.

- **Resolve Circular Imports**: All circular import errors have been resolved by ensuring a clean, unidirectional dependency flow: Routers -> Dependencies -> Services -> Repositories.

- **Standardize Dependency Usage**: All routers (`categories`, `activity_logs`, `daily_logs`) have been updated to use the new centralized `CurrentUser` dependency from `deps.py`, ensuring consistent and robust authorization.
